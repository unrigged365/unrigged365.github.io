*Understanding the systemic risks of record-high valuations driven by speculative AI investments and what economic consequences await when reality catches up to market expectations*

---

Global stock markets are currently at record highs. Whether examining the FTSE 100 in the UK, the S&P 500 in the United States, or any other major index worldwide, technology and artificial intelligence have driven share valuations into unprecedented territory. Yet beneath this optimism lies a troubling consensus: everyone knows it's a bubble. Serious investors understand what they're doing, but they remain trapped in the dance, desperately trying to secure one last ounce of value before the inevitable collapse—even though none can genuinely predict when to exit.

History suggests this situation will not end differently than previous bubbles. The crashes of 1987, 2000, 2008, and others all shared similar characteristics. When this bubble bursts, the shock will be global, far-reaching, and deeply interconnected across financial systems in ways many don't fully appreciate.

## The Delusion at the Heart of Current Valuations

The fundamental problem is straightforward: investors are placing trillions of dollars into artificial intelligence profits that do not yet exist. No one knows how to use AI efficiently. No one understands what true value it will create. Yet the capital continues to flow.

This is not rational investment. This is collective delusion.

When a stock market crash occurs, the immediate perception is that money vanishes. But this understanding requires nuance. Most of what disappears is paper value—theoretical wealth that existed only in market prices, not in tangible assets or real economic capacity.

To understand this distinction, consider the stock market crash as comparable to a supermarket markdown on baked beans. When prices are reduced on a shelf, the beans remain. Buyers may even purchase more because they perceive greater value. Only the price tag changes. The physical reality remains unchanged.

The stock market and actual economic reality only vaguely overlap with one another. When share prices fall, the real assets that exist in the real economy—the ones creating real jobs, employing real people, meeting real needs—carry on largely unchanged. The factories still exist. The workers still live. The infrastructure remains intact.

But perception matters enormously.

## The Cascade of Real Damage

While the initial crash represents mostly paper losses, the consequences for real people and real institutions are far more tangible.

Pension funds will take the first substantial hit. Employers offering defined benefit pension schemes—where they've guaranteed to pay a fixed proportion of employees' earnings during retirement—will be forced to plug the gap created by falling share valuations. These companies will be compelled to divert money away from real investment in their businesses and instead pour it into purchasing alternative shares, hoping their value doesn't continue falling.

This diversion is destructive to economic growth. Real investment in productive capacity declines. Real people who would have worked on those investment projects lose income. The future benefits that would have resulted from those projects never materialize.

For retirees enrolled in defined contribution schemes—where pension amounts depend on actual investment returns including capital gains—the situation can be devastating. Those nearing retirement face completely altered plans. Retirements anticipated for years become impossible. People may need to work longer or accept lower living standards for the remainder of their lives. These are not abstract statistical losses. They represent shattered personal plans and diminished futures.

## The Banking System Contagion

The most dangerous element involves those who have borrowed heavily to purchase shares, betting that prices would always rise and cover their borrowing costs. Hedge funds, private equity firms, and shadow banking institutions operate almost entirely on borrowed money. They live on debt.

When stock markets crash, these declines happen with shocking speed. On a single day, it is not uncommon for 10% of a market's value to evaporate. Consider the FTSE 100, currently valued at approximately 2.3 trillion pounds. If 10% disappeared in one day, 230 billion pounds of apparent value would vanish instantly.

Looking at longer-term collapses—examining the patterns from 2000 and 2008—the ultimate bottom might represent a 30 to 40% decline from peak valuations. Using the UK market as an example, this could mean up to 1 trillion pounds of value eventually disappearing. Those who borrowed to buy shares would be unable to repay their loans.

When borrowers cannot repay banks, the banking system itself takes a hit—starting from day one. As soon as it becomes apparent that banks have issued loans to institutions that cannot repay, bank valuations decline. Trust erodes. Banks stop trusting each other, fearing they don't understand the true value of other institutions' assets. This cascades into a very real economic shock.

## Lessons Unlearned

In 2000, policymakers managed the crisis competently, though few people recognized it at the time. In 2008, when the full financial crisis struck, banks were at the epicenter of the collapse. Governments faced an unavoidable choice: bail out the banking system or allow the payment infrastructure itself to topple, leaving citizens unable to make basic transactions.

The critical point is this: the current bubble is larger than either previous crisis, and the system is more interconnected than it was in 2008. Increased technology integration has created bigger vulnerabilities because everything connects more tightly. Simultaneously, the rise of shadow banking—where roughly half of all loans flow through institutions that are not technically banks but function like them—has created even greater systemic risk.

Yet the lessons from 2008 were never truly implemented. Retail banking was never separated from speculative finance. Banking culture never changed fundamentally. Bonus caps were eventually scrapped. Risk was permitted to remain embedded in the system. Every promise made after 2008 to prevent future crises was effectively abandoned.

The FTSE 100 chart tells this story visually. Currently at 9,760, it spent extended periods at around 6,000, which represents roughly a 40% decline from current levels. It could even fall lower. Following the 2008 crisis, the index dropped to just around 4,000. A repeat of that scenario would represent more than a 50% decline from today's levels.

## The Path Forward

When this inevitable collapse occurs, the choice before policymakers will be stark: repeat the errors of 2008, or rebuild a just financial order.

The first requirement is creating state banking infrastructure so that citizens' fundamental right to make payments—a right inherent to a public currency created by government—exists independently of privately-owned banks prone to reckless behavior. Public-facing banking must be separated from casino finance.

Second, regulations must address hedge funds and private equity directly. These are not signs of entrepreneurial vigor. They represent systemic risk to the entire financial system and will cause a collapse that ordinary citizens will ultimately pay for.

Third, government must treat the financial sector appropriately—as a guest of the state following the house rules, not as the master setting the rules.

Fourth, when government intervention becomes necessary to stabilize the system, that stimulus must not flow to the wealthy through asset price inflation, as happened after 2010. Investment must go into productive capacity and real jobs, not into speculation that further inflates housing and asset prices.

The financial crisis represents the final showdown for neoliberalism as a governing philosophy. It is failing and will fail. The response to that failure will determine whether future generations inherit a financial system serving society or one that continues to extract value from it.

The bubble will burst. History demonstrates this as inevitable. When even the Bank of England and major financial commentators agree that collapse is certain, that outcome is assured. But crises can become opportunities. They represent moments when reform becomes possible—if political leadership chooses to serve people rather than finance.

The choice now is whether to rebuild a financial system that serves everyone or to repeat the failures of the past. That decision will shape the world for decades to come.
