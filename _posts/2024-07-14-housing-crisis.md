*It's not what you think — and it's happening everywhere*

---

Walk into any coffee shop in London, New York, Vancouver, or Sydney, and you'll hear the same conversation. Young professionals lamenting skyrocketing rents. Families pushed further from city centers. Everyone convinced their city has a uniquely terrible housing crisis.

But here's the thing: if everyone thinks their city has a uniquely terrible housing problem, then maybe the problem isn't unique to any city at all.

## It's Not Just Your City

The housing affordability crisis is genuinely global. From Tokyo to Toronto, from Mumbai to Melbourne, people in every major city believe they're facing an unprecedented local housing disaster. Politicians blame local planning policies. Residents point fingers at their mayors. Everyone assumes the solution lies in their backyard.

This universal experience should tell us something important: if housing is unaffordable everywhere, the cause can't be local. It can't be just bad planning in San Francisco, or just immigration in London, or just zoning laws in Toronto. When a problem is this widespread, it demands a global explanation.

## It's Not Just Housing

Here's where the story gets interesting. The housing crisis isn't actually a housing crisis at all — it's an asset crisis.

Since 2020, gold prices have more than doubled. Stock markets worldwide are hitting record highs. Farmland prices have skyrocketed. Luxury art, vintage cars, even collectible watches — virtually every asset class has seen dramatic price increases.

Think about this for a moment. If you walked into a supermarket and found that the price of coffee, bread, milk, and everything else had tripled, would you assume something strange had happened specifically to coffee? Or would you recognize that something fundamental had changed with money itself?

Yet when it comes to housing, we consistently treat it as an isolated market. We debate construction rates and immigration policies while ignoring that house prices are rising alongside every other asset. We're trying to solve a forest fire by examining individual trees.

## The Simple Truth About Money and Assets

The explanation is surprisingly straightforward: when wealthy people receive money, they buy assets.

This isn't a moral judgment — it's basic economic behavior. If you already have enough money to cover your living expenses, where does additional income go? Not toward more groceries or another winter coat. It goes toward investments: stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, art.

When massive amounts of new money enter the economy — whether through quantitative easing, pandemic relief programs, or simply the ongoing concentration of wealth — the wealthy portion of that money flows directly into asset markets. This drives up prices across all asset classes simultaneously.

Regular people, meanwhile, use additional money for consumption: paying bills, buying necessities, maybe taking a vacation. They're not competing in asset markets because they can't afford to.

## The Hidden Role of Mortgages

Housing seems different from other assets because many ordinary people do own homes. But this masks what's really happening.

When wealthy individuals and institutions accumulate money, they don't necessarily buy houses directly. Instead, they provide the credit that becomes mortgages. The end result on housing prices is identical whether a billionaire buys a house outright or lends money to someone else to buy it.

This is why mortgage sizes have grown so dramatically. It's not just that people are borrowing more — it's that wealthy lenders have more money available to lend, and they're competing with each other to deploy that capital.

You can only live in one house, but you can own a thousand through mortgage lending. You can only drive one car, but you can own shares in every major automaker. The wealthy aren't constrained by their personal consumption needs when it comes to asset ownership.

## Why "Just Build More" Misses the Point

The most common proposed solution to housing unaffordability is simple: build more houses. It sounds logical. More supply should mean lower prices, right?

But if you're dealing with a global asset price inflation, how many houses would you need to build to counteract trillions of dollars flowing into asset markets? If your house is flooding, you don't save it by bailing water with a bucket while ignoring the burst dam upstream.

Moreover, in highly unequal economies, who decides what gets built? The same wealthy interests driving up asset prices control the resources needed for construction. They choose what to build based on who can pay. In a world where wealth is increasingly concentrated, that means luxury housing for the wealthy and minimal-quality housing for everyone else.

This is why many cities are simultaneously experiencing both luxury construction booms and housing affordability crises. The market is working exactly as it should — it's just serving a very different customer base than it did fifty years ago.

## The Historical Context

Here's a perspective that might surprise you: historically speaking, the period when housing was affordable — roughly 1950 to 1980 in many Western countries — was the anomaly, not today's unaffordability.

For most of human history, in societies with high inequality, ordinary people couldn't afford decent housing. Read Dickens if you want a reminder of what London housing looked like during previous periods of wealth concentration. Look at contemporary cities in highly unequal countries like Mumbai or São Paulo, where luxury centers are surrounded by vast slums.

The post-World War II period saw historically low levels of wealth inequality in many developed countries. Assets were more broadly distributed. More people could compete in housing markets because wealth itself was more evenly distributed.

As inequality has returned to historical norms — or exceeded them — we're seeing a return to historical patterns of asset ownership and housing affordability.

## The Shape of Unequal Cities

Inequality doesn't just affect who can afford housing — it reshapes entire cities and regions.

In relatively equal societies, workers and consumers are the same people. Everyone earns money and everyone spends money, so communities can be balanced and self-sustaining.

But as inequality grows, you get a split between workers and consumers. A small wealthy class has most of the spending power, while everyone else works but can't afford much. This creates economic pressure for workers to cluster around wealthy areas, leading to the luxury-center-surrounded-by-slums pattern visible in many unequal countries.

We're seeing this pattern emerge in developed countries too. Expensive city centers become playgrounds for the wealthy, while everyone else gets pushed to increasingly distant, lower-quality housing.

## Looking Forward

Understanding the housing crisis as part of a broader asset price inflation reframes the entire discussion. It's not about construction techniques or planning permissions or immigration policy — though these factors matter at the margins.

It's about the fundamental distribution of economic power in our societies. When wealth concentrates at the top, asset prices rise beyond the reach of ordinary people. This affects not just housing, but healthcare, education, and every other essential service that competes for the same underlying resources.

The housing crisis is really a story about who gets to own the future. Right now, that's increasingly the people who already own the present.
