*Public debt in advanced economies has reached historic levels. Understanding the problem—and why solving it seems nearly impossible—matters more than ever.*

Advanced economies are facing a fiscal reckoning. Public debt levels have climbed to their highest point since the Napoleonic Wars, yet policymakers across the developed world remain remarkably quiet about the challenge ahead. The question isn't whether this matters—it clearly does. The real question is whether political systems can address it before circumstances force their hand.

## How We Got Here: A Series of Crises and Political Choices

The trajectory of public debt in wealthy nations didn't happen by accident. Over recent decades, a series of major disruptions—the 2008 global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2022 energy crisis in Europe—created step-change increases in government spending. Each crisis required unprecedented fiscal intervention, and each left debt levels permanently higher.

But crises alone don't explain the full picture. There's a deeper political dynamic at play. Across advanced economies, governments have demonstrated a consistent inability to balance spending with revenue. Deficits continue to mount not because policymakers lack the tools to control them, but because the political incentives push in the opposite direction.

What's particularly striking is what observers call "studied indifference." The debt problem is the elephant in the room—acknowledged in economic circles but largely absent from serious political debate. In the United States, there's a sense that strong economic growth will ultimately solve the problem, making urgent action unnecessary. Meanwhile, in Europe and Japan, the challenge is discussed but rarely confronted directly.

## The Forecasting Trap: Debt Is Always Higher Than Expected

One consistent pattern emerges when examining long-term fiscal projections: actual debt ends up higher than forecasted. This happens for several reasons. Budget forecasters typically don't account for unforeseen crises—pandemics, wars, or other major disruptions fall outside standard modeling. But there's also a more mundane explanation: forecasters are often too optimistic about future productivity growth and economic performance.

In Britain, for instance, official projections have repeatedly assumed stronger productivity gains than actually materialized. The gap between forecast and reality accumulates over time, pushing debt higher than anticipated.

## The Perfect Storm: Multiple Pressures Colliding

The challenge ahead isn't simply high debt in isolation. Advanced economies face a convergence of pressures that will push fiscal balances in the wrong direction:

**Aging populations** mean rising spending on healthcare and pensions. Governments haven't adjusted retirement ages in line with increased life expectancy, and the political power of elderly voters makes cutting benefits nearly impossible. The welfare state, which began as a means to provide national infrastructure and defense, has gradually transformed into an insurance system for old-age benefits—consuming an ever-larger share of government budgets.

**Defense spending** is rising, particularly in Europe, where new NATO commitments require substantially increased military budgets. This trend reverses decades of declining defense spending as a share of GDP.

**Green transition costs** represent another major budget item, as governments invest in decarbonization and climate-related infrastructure.

**Interest rates** have risen sharply since the pandemic. Unlike the post-2008 era, when central banks maintained near-zero rates for over a decade, the current environment features significantly higher borrowing costs. This means governments pay more in interest payments, crowding out spending on other priorities.

When these pressures are combined and added to existing high debt levels, the picture becomes alarming. Even optimistic forecasts incorporating all these factors likely underestimate where debt is heading.

## The Stability Illusion: Why High Debt Creates Vulnerability

Japan demonstrated for many years that economies can sustain high debt levels if interest rates remain low. The Japanese model showed that debt-to-GDP ratios could reach extreme levels without triggering a crisis, provided that global interest rates stayed depressed and capital remained willing to finance government borrowing.

But this model creates a hidden vulnerability. High debt means thin margins for error. The higher the debt load, the smaller the rise in interest rates needed to create a serious problem. When rates change—and historically, they always do—countries with high debt face a brutal choice: accept economic crisis or implement deep austerity and major structural adjustments.

Even seemingly "stable" debt situations become fragile in this environment. Circumstances change, global interest rates shift, and suddenly what looked manageable becomes unsustainable. Vulnerability isn't just about current conditions; it's about how much room for adjustment remains when conditions deteriorate.

## The Tax Question: Potential Solutions and Political Reality

Theoretically, governments could address the fiscal challenge through revenue increases. The feasibility varies dramatically by geography.

The United States has exceptional capacity to raise more revenue. American tax levels remain low by developed-world standards. The country has no value-added tax (VAT), despite this being a relatively efficient revenue source used across Europe. A prominent Harvard economist has argued that if the U.S. wanted to fix its fiscal problem overnight, it could—the mechanisms exist. The barrier is purely political. Republicans have historically opposed a VAT precisely because it's such an effective tool for raising government revenue, which would enable larger government.

Europe occupies a middle position. Countries like Britain claim their taxes are at historic highs, yet Britain remains on the lower end of the European tax range historically. This leaves some room for revenue increases, though less than the United States.

Japan sits between these extremes, with moderate tax capacity remaining.

However, there's an important caveat: as tax levels rise, the design and efficiency of tax systems becomes increasingly critical. If tax policy becomes politicized and shaped by populist concerns—through wealth taxes or other economically inefficient measures—governments can do real damage to growth even at relatively moderate tax levels.

The political will to substantially raise taxes in rich democracies appears limited. This suggests that solving the fiscal challenge through revenue increases alone is unlikely.

## The Spending Problem: Even Harder Than Raising Taxes

If raising taxes faces political obstacles, cutting spending confronts even steeper challenges. A chart of U.S. federal spending illustrates the problem clearly, and the pattern holds across developed economies: approximately two-fifths of spending goes to age-related benefits and defense.

This represents a fundamental shift in the purpose of government. Half a century ago, government budgets prioritized national defense and infrastructure. The welfare state has gradually transformed this equation. As populations aged and political power shifted toward retirees, government became primarily an insurance company providing old-age benefits and healthcare for the elderly and poor.

Why is this politically irreversible? The elderly have become a dominant electoral force. Unlike mid-20th century concerns that welfare states would be captured by a broad populist coalition of middle-class voters, the reality proved different: elderly voters have made it nearly impossible to cut pension spending. Retirement ages haven't risen with life expectancy. The political power of this demographic group is too great.

Outside of entitlements and defense, there's simply not much left to cut. Infrastructure spending, which once formed a core government function, represents a small share of budgets and is widely viewed as already inadequate. The remaining discretionary spending offers minimal savings potential.

## The Pessimist's Conclusion: A Problem Without a Solution

Examining both sides of the fiscal equation leads to a sobering assessment: there appears to be no viable political path to addressing the debt challenge.

Tax increases face institutional and ideological resistance, particularly in countries like the United States where low taxation remains part of the political identity. Spending cuts confront an aging electorate with the political power to protect pension and healthcare benefits. Defense spending is rising, not falling, especially in Europe. Green transition costs continue to accumulate.

Trapped between these pressures, advanced economies will likely continue accumulating debt until circumstances force action. That moment may come when interest rates spike, when investors lose confidence in government bonds, or when some combination of shocks overwhelms the system's capacity to absorb them.

The studied indifference surrounding this challenge may persist until complacency becomes impossible. By then, the adjustments required will be far more painful than the gradual fiscal consolidation that could still be implemented today.
